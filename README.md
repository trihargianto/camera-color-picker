<hr />

This tool aims to answer "What Color is this?" question.

But why on earth this tool was built in the first place? This is because I need a tool to help a [color-blind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness) person like me to recognize color in this world easily by using Camera.

## Local Installation
